* Neat Lambda

A shorthand syntax for writing lambda expressions in common lisp.

** Motivation

Often it's inconvenient to write out a full lambda expression in
Common Lisp. Instead of this

#+begin_src lisp
  (mapcar (lambda (a b) (list (max a b) (min a b))) '(1 5 3) '(4 2 6))
#+end_src

It would be nice to write

#+begin_src lisp
  (mapcar #l(list (max %1 %2) (min %1 %2)) '(1 5 3) '(4 2 6))
#+end_src

This library provides a reader macro that enables this.
